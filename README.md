<h1>ImageProcessing</h1>


<h5>This is project created for the study of Image Processing techniques through the usage 
of Octave</h5>

<h2>Setting yourself up:</h2>

<ol>
<li>
	<p>Octave is basically the Matlab OpenSource alternative and can be downloaded in <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/">here.</a> When it comes to the manipulation of image's properties, it is required to download the Octave Forge package named image which can be downloaded <a href="https://octave.sourceforge.io/packages.php">here</a> or through Octave itself. </p>
</li>

<li>
	<p>To install the image package on Octave through itself just type the following command:</p>
	<p><i>pkg install image</i></p>
</li> 

<li>
	<p>Now, just load the package image using the following command:</p>
	<p><i>pkg load image</i></p> 

</li> 
</ol>

<p>Now you are ready to use the scripts created in this repository, the scripts here teach basic operations using images(geometric, arithmetic and logic) and intermediary ones such as histogram compression and expansion in addition to methods for image filtering.</p>

<p>The contents are organized with the examples growing in complexity based on the following themes:</p>

<ol>
	<li><b>Lab 2:</b> introduction to basic image manipulation functions </li>
	<li><b>Lab 3:</b> logic, Arithmetic and statistic image manipulation tools </li>
	<li><b>Lab 4:</b> geometric transformations for image manipulation</li>
	<li><b>Lab 5:</b> image histogram modification techniques</li>
	<li><b>Lab 6:</b> image filtering through spatial domain</li>
	<li><b>Lab 7:</b> mathematical morphology for image processing </li>
</ol>
